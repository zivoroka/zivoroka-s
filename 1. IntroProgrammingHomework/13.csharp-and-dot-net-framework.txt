Difference between C# and .NET Framework

.NET Framework is a software framework developed by Microsoft that runs primarily on Microsoft Windows.
It includes a large class library known as Framework Class Library (FCL) and provides language 
interoperability (each language can use code written in other languages) across several programming languages. 
.NET Framework isn't just a library, but also a runtime for executing applications.
C#  is class-based programming language. It is using .net library (because the C# object model corresponds to the .NET object model). The opposite isn't necessarily true as you can use other languages to write .NET applications.
The distinction between a language and runtime and library is more strict in .NET/C# than for example in C++, where the language specification also includes some basic library functions. The C# specification says only a very little about the environment (basically, that it should contain some types such as int, but that's more or less all).

C# is a programming language, .NET is a blanket term that tends to cover both the .NET Framework (an application framework library) and the Common Language Runtime which is the runtime in which .NET assemblies are run.
Microsoft's implementation of C# is heavily integrated with the .NET Framework so it is understandable that the two concepts would be confused. However it is important to understand that they are two very different things.
